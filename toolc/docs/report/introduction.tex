After implementing the so-called "toolc"-compiler, which compiles a very basic computer language, we now would like to extend it with first class functions. This means that we allow function declartions to be assigned to variables, to be passed as parameters to functions or to be returned from functions.
The most difficult part consists in correctly attaching the non-local variables, which are internally used, to the first class function (Closure). The problem is often referred as the funarg problem.
