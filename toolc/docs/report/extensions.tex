Many of the previously enumerated steps are quite dependants on each other,
and doing this project iteratively was complicated. Therefore, few blocking
bugs are still present in the provided implementation, mainly caused by the
medium quality of generated code. The legacy from previous labs were quite difficult
to manage; indeed, previous code wasn't made to be re-usable in a new step,
so we had do "backport" parts of the mechanisms, like symbol collections or
type generating (with the newly generated code).

With a peer-review and some bugfixing, the provided code would be able to
support all the closures mechanism.

Of course, in a addition to these improvements, we could work on anonymous inline class
declarations, runtime method injecting (creating methods at runtime) or how to
implement Prototype-Oriented Programming in Tool (as in ECMAScript).
